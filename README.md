# Housing Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the code for a regression machine learning model that predicts housing prices based on various features from the housing dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of actual vs predicted values.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes various features such as the number of rooms, population, and proximity to the ocean, which are used to predict the median house value.
